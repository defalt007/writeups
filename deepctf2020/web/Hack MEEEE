This challenge is a bit advanced challenge as it would require BURP to be done effectively, yet we can do this with the developer tools in the browser AKA inspect element

go to the developer options for the *SUBMIT* button

here we are gonna change this line

<option value="encode_base64">Encode base64</option>
to
<option value="methods">Encode base64</option>
and send submit

what we get in response are the methods available to send, what we want are 
:instance_eval, :instance_exec

we go with instance_exec first
and get a hacker detected response

then we use the other available method instance_eval
but now we have to change the value being sent as well

`ls` and method=instance_eval
we get the list of files now similiary we use cat to get our flag
`cat flag.txt` and method=instance_eval
