Description
An army of hackers has stolen the flag from our rabbits. Security experts have failed to capture the flag and some have even gone mad. Pleaseâ€¦GIMME THE FLAG!!

One of the first thing we should test on new website... is to see if there's a robots.txt, and indeed:

Disallow: /deep.php
open it and we'll found:

deep.php/page=debug.html
If we look at the url we will see that it is including a file, most likely we are facing an LFI, but we do not know the location of the flag, so we go with the next logical step, look at the source code of the page and surprise !:

<!-- Creds in /home/ubuntu/key2.txt -->
we have already located the path of key2.txt, we edit the url to open this file and we should get this

key2=flag0x085927

we need to get two keys in order to generate the flag under the title "Troll Gimme"

Ok, To locate key1, seeing the amount of comments that there are on the web referring to key we started to read all the code that we could find on the web, first html, and then css ... 

our search for key 1 ends at this, right under our noses on the homepage or index
http://140.238.254.6:8005/css/clean-blog.css

and look at what we found in one of them:

	* key1= gimme0x038792
we already have both keys! we only need to enter them in the form and we get the flag
