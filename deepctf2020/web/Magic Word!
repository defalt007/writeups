on moving ahead by clicking on the *view page source* 

we get this crazy what you say and what he listens thing, after cracking my head for a while it finally made some sense

so i made a get request as follows

140.238.254.6:8004/?magic_word=d33p

we went no where !

so i tried to change the way i sent d33p
d33pd33p
this didnt work
d3d33p3p
worked for us 

// The program removes any d33p found in the request so you need to craft the request to bypass this filter

when we send d3d33p3p it removes the middle d33p but does not removes the d3----3p which then joins to form d33p and gives us our flag
  
What did you just say to me?!?! d33p{d33p_p33d}
